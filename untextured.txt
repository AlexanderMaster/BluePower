Blocks
******

[computer blocks] most have existing basic texture to work from. 
cpu_front (up for debate as to what design, for some reason mirrored on the block)
cpu_side (for some reason it's rotated on the block though)
cpu_back
cpu_top
cpu_bottom
disk_drive_front (red dots are activity lights, so need unlit version as well)
monitor_front (for some reason mirrored on the block)
io_expander_front (temp textures needed, final design relies on implementation of activity lights and also should be half height block)
io_expander_back (temp textures needed, final design relies on bundled cable shape/texture and also should be half height block))
